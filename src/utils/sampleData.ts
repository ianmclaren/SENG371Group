          "Programming is the process of designing and writing computer programs. It is a set of instructions that helps the developer to perform certain tasks that return the desired output for the valid inputs. Programs consist of a series of instructions to tell a computer exactly what to do and how to do it.",
          "Computer programming is the process of designing and developing various sets of computer programs to accomplish a specific computing outcome. As a skill set, it includes a wide variety of different tasks and techniques. Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer). Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.",
          "Programming follows a syntax or a set of rules that define particular layouts of letters and symbols. Proper syntax ensures the computer reads and interprets code accurately. Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart, and programming is the translation of these into a computer program.",
          "Programming languages are how humans communicate with computers. They include numeric, string and boolean types. For example, if using number data type, the program will know that arithmetic can be performed on it, but it canâ€™t be capitalized.",
